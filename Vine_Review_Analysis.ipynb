She tore into it and did all the designs. We both noticed that the spinner wasn't really needed. I thought she had fun spinning it, but she claims not so much. She likes Qixels and it keeps her busy and entertained. I think it's a fun crafty toy for her age range. I think she would sooner have had more patterns and beads than the drier though.<br /><br />Bottom line: The kids love these kits. She will want more. They make a great gift for the age range.<br /><br />Notes from Sophie (11):<br />- You don't really need the drier and it's kinda loud<br />- Came with the same amount of designs and beads as a theme pack (4)<br />- You can do it without any parents help<br />- Can be used up quick<br />- There is a lot of packing trash<br />- A lot like Beados but squares                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

As you can see in the video I go from never having seen one to riding it comfortably in ten minutes.  The hardest part about learning to ride it was that all the neighbor kids wanted a turn!  I really was enjoying it until I was able to get it above a few miles an hour, then I felt the slight rub on the right wheel that became worse at increased speeds.  Then after charging it a second time I began to have issues with the battery.  Every time I rode for more than five minutes the red battery light started blinking and the warning alarm buzzed.  I'd recharge it then try to ride it but then it started buzzing after riding it for three minutes.  So I contacted the Leray people through the warranty card in the box: they immediately emailed me a return UPS label and as soon as they received my scooter they sent me a new one.  Seamless.<br /><br />The new one works fine: it charged up in under an hour and I rode for an hour this afternoon.  It's really addictive!  If you want to have some fun, I highly recommend getting one these scooters.<br /><br />PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.)

Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.  Frankly, I would have loved this toy as a child.  What the heck, I love this toy as an adult.  Then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.<br /><br />Enjoy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |2015-08-31 |\n",

The pieces are separated into bags like the Lego sets BUT the likeness STOPS there. There is no purpose to the bags. Pieces for the castle are spread among all the bags, even the ones that look like they are for the figures. The directions pictures of the small pieces are VERY small and it is hard to distinguish some of them.

Unfortunately we've been disappointed with it.<br /><br />1. The camera is definitely of lower quality, It does not have a weighted base but instead a suction cup, and the head of the camera (the end where all the functional stuff is and the lens) is much heavier, so it's quite top heavy. The suction cup is not a good idea as it doesn't make up for a weighted base, especially since it doesn't stick to many surfaces. We've not had any issues with the Hue camera falling over and luckily it does not have a suction cup, but the Animate it camera cannot stand on it's own and must be suction attached to something. The quality of the images the camera in this Animate it kit produces are not clear. The Hue camera can be focused directly by turning the lens, and while the camera on this kit has a lens that turns as well, we were not able to get it very clear. It is interesting to note that on the Animate it website & Amazon page the image of the lens shows information written on the ring of the lens stating it's resolution and zoom, however, the camera in the kit does not have any of this printed information. I don't know if that indicates this has a different camera/lens or not, but it's definitely a poor quality one. The Hue camera also has a speaker built into the camera, so if you are doing audio voice over you're all set with the camera/microphone all-in-one.<br /><br />2. This Animate it kit comes with little plastic doo-hickeys (the OgoSport/OgoBild things) that you can create little creatures with as the subject of your animation. My daughter was not at all interested in these, preferring instead to use clay (our Hue kit from a couple years ago came with clay, but the newer ones seem not to anymore, and instead include a klutz animation book). This is just personal preference, but something to note. It seems to me that these plastic things might appeal to younger kids? My daughter is 11.<br /><br />3. The software, while adequate for most kids, isn't as comprehensive as the Hue animation software. It also doesn't have as good of instructions (video instructions for the Hue are really great and make each step to make animations very easy to figure out and do). My daughter was 8 when we first used the Hue kit and I did have to help her with some activities, especially some editing and splicing in music so the fade ins and outs were right where we wanted them, but once she got going she was very independent in creating her films.<br /><br />Some folks have mentioned that they don't feel the software with this Animate it kit is limited (it's called animate it express because it has less features than their fully fledged Animate it software) However, it doesn't offer all the features you can do on the Hue software, esp. related to editing, splicing in music, having different audio tracks, etc. It's just much more basic. Many kids may be happy with the more basic software, but once you've had more control and options for your animations it's hard to give some of that up.<br /><br />4. Price - the price of this kit is definitely less than the Hue kit, but also bear in mind that the Hue has a longer history and has won all kinds of awards, is used in schools, and overall has a much better camera and full featured software. I think if your kid is 10+, and/or really into animation they'll be much happier with the Hue kit. Younger kids may be just fine with this kit (although the camera will frustrate you no matter what your age).<br /><br />SUMMARY: Based on our experience with both this kit and the HUE kit, the HUE is the clear winner for overall quality and features (and I think for learning to use it, but that's subjective and others may feel the software for this Animate it kit is just as easy)ut that's subjective and others may feel the software for this Animate it kit is just as easy)|2015-08-31 |\n",

At first she didn't seem interested so I didn't push it. After sitting on her shelf for a couple of months, she finally expressed an interest in learning to start to sew. Upon opening it and going thru everything we decided to get started on the basic pouch so she could get used to the simple steps.<br /><br />The instructions were not clear enough for a nine year old to understand without lots of help from an adult. I would like to have seen &#34;kid friendly &#34; instructions included so she could feel more successful.<br /><br />The thread was very hard to get through the eye of the needle that was included in this kit, so I gave her a needle with a larger eye, from my sewing kit.<br /><br />After the beginning project, she was able to complete the stuffed animal projects with a little to no assistance from me.<br /><br />Although I do not sew as a hobby, this was a good place for my grand daughter to start exploring the sewing world and I think shes hooked!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |2015-08-31 |\n",

I'm not sure where all these tiny cats are that they sell cat tubes for, but it's a little ridiculous. They love it!, with clips you can bend it into different shapes or connect the tunnels.

Then there is the rescan line that is smaller in scale- Blurr, bumblebee motorcycle, optimus monster truck, Boulder dump truck, Medix, Hoist.  The quality of the rescan size isn't as good as the energize bots, a bit more sticky in their movements.  Knowing this will save you some disappointment in quality and size.<br /><br />My boys love all things rescue bots and love the different sizes for different missions.  If you have the opportunity check these out in stores to see different styles, sizes and prices.<br /><br />The energize bots are easy enough for my 1-2 yr old.

She immediately started putting toys on top of &#34;her&#34; table - as obviously this was for her and NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE LOL!<br /><br /> She has had a little difficulty getting onto the chairs properly.  She is 32&#34; tall but her butt level is lower than the chair seat so she tries to &#34;scoot&#34; onto the chair and can only get a small part of her bum onto it.  Then as she tries to &#34;scoot&#34;onto the chair it pushes away from her.  The chairs are very light and even on an area rug move when she tries to get in them.  She has already learned to kind of half sit on the chair and wait for grandma & granddad to lift her the rest of the way onto the chair.  Her feet do not touch the floor when seated but she slides off the chair and hasn't had a problem on the dismount ha ha.  I think another inch or so of growth and the problem will be resolved.<br /><br />My Yorkie also loves the table as when my granddaughter is having lunch or her snack, he is right in feeding range - she does the one bite for you - one bite for the dog eating method - and they both enjoy this immensely.  I was going to try and tell her &#34;don't feed the dog&#34; but she has so much fun doing it I just can't tell her no (I would have never let my kids do this, but grandkids, that is a whole different story).<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice little table that doesn't take a lot of room and is easy to move inside and outside the house.  Works well as a play surface and can also be used for meals/snacks.  I was going to get a Little Tikes picnic table but decided to try this instead and am glad I did.  Picnic table wouldn't have been nearly as portable and would have taken a lot more space.  The two chairs fit completely under the table when not is use so great for anyone who wants a play table for their toddler with limited space.<br /><br />Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |2015-08-31 |\n",

You install the app and once you've created an account, it walks you through it. You'll be prompted to install an update, then restart your pet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Very soft plush material<br />• Can be used on android or Apple devices<br /> - I have an iPhone & my husband has a Samsung and both worked well<br />• record & receive messages (your child can respond to you over the cloud)<br />• Extras in your child's menu:<br />  • lullabies (Ba-Ba Black Sheep, This Old Man, Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star, Welsh Lullaby) that have multiple settings<br />  • 5, 8, 10, 12, & 15 minutes<br />  • low, medium, high volume<br /> • 2 Read-A-Long stories<br />  • Barnyard Sounds game<br />  • Access your child's messages to send to your CloudPet<br /><br />Cons:<br />• needs more in-depth instructions or walk/through on the app for invite recipients<br />  - I helped my husband figure it out, but I'm pretty sure I'd need to show my mother or anyone else not as tech-savvy how to do it in person  (p.s. don't tell my mom I said that about her :) )<br />• You need to manually go into your child's menu in the app to send any messages you've recorded or that others have sent (this could also be a &#34;pro&#34;, but I was under the impression that if I sent it on my device while in Bluetooth range, it would send automatically)<br />• don't hold down the blue button too long while playing a message or it shorts out [perhaps] - you'll know if that's happened if you hear a feedback sound and the buttons are no longer responsive. ** this can be fixed by turning the CloudPet off, then back on again. Also easily avoided if you watch your kiddo with it & by not holding the button longer than necessary<br />• 10 second record time for mom/dad recording VS 18 seconds for your child to record a response. It would be nice to have an extended option for messages sent to child as well<br /><br />** If you are using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this; however, the application does not.<br /><br />My daughter and I are really enjoying this toy, as well as the rest of my family.

It's intended for younger kids, but both my four year old and eight year old boys pretend play for hours with this.  It comes with food and accessories.<br /><br />It does really cool things and plays catchy little songs about pizza, bread, washing hands and so much more!  The sounds even teach counting.

I was surprised at the fact I could keep it in the air without losing control or hitting a wall!  I have mastered landing it on my Remote Control Helicopter Landing pad!<br />Can be flown indoors or outdoors. When flying outdoors the wind may effect your flying as this helicopter is very light.<br />Has red and blue lights that flash which allows you to fly at night, pair it with a remote control helicopter landing pad and you have the perfect set up for night flying.<br />Flying time has ranged from 7 to 15 minutes for me, flying time is less outside depending on the breeze.<br />Very easy to control, although I have yet to master what every button on the remote does!

She tore into it and did all the designs. We both noticed that the spinner wasn't really needed. I thought she had fun spinning it, but she claims not so much. She likes Qixels and it keeps her busy and entertained. I think it's a fun crafty toy for her age range. I think she would sooner have had more patterns and beads than the drier though.<br /><br />Bottom line: The kids love these kits. She will want more. They make a great gift for the age range.<br /><br />Notes from Sophie (11):<br />- You don't really need the drier and it's kinda loud<br />- Came with the same amount of designs and beads as a theme pack (4)<br />- You can do it without any parents help<br />- Can be used up quick<br />- There is a lot of packing trash<br />- A lot like Beados but squares                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2015-08-31 |\n",

As you can see in the video I go from never having seen one to riding it comfortably in ten minutes.  The hardest part about learning to ride it was that all the neighbor kids wanted a turn!  I really was enjoying it until I was able to get it above a few miles an hour, then I felt the slight rub on the right wheel that became worse at increased speeds.  Then after charging it a second time I began to have issues with the battery.  Every time I rode for more than five minutes the red battery light started blinking and the warning alarm buzzed.  I'd recharge it then try to ride it but then it started buzzing after riding it for three minutes.  So I contacted the Leray people through the warranty card in the box: they immediately emailed me a return UPS label and as soon as they received my scooter they sent me a new one.  Seamless.<br /><br />The new one works fine: it charged up in under an hour and I rode for an hour this afternoon.  It's really addictive!  If you want to have some fun, I highly recommend getting one these scooters.<br /><br />PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.)

Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.  Frankly, I would have loved this toy as a child.  What the heck, I love this toy as an adult.  Then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.<br /><br />Enjoy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |2015-08-31 |\n",

Unfortunately we've been disappointed with it.<br /><br />1. The camera is definitely of lower quality, It does not have a weighted base but instead a suction cup, and the head of the camera (the end where all the functional stuff is and the lens) is much heavier, so it's quite top heavy. The suction cup is not a good idea as it doesn't make up for a weighted base, especially since it doesn't stick to many surfaces. We've not had any issues with the Hue camera falling over and luckily it does not have a suction cup, but the Animate it camera cannot stand on it's own and must be suction attached to something. The quality of the images the camera in this Animate it kit produces are not clear. The Hue camera can be focused directly by turning the lens, and while the camera on this kit has a lens that turns as well, we were not able to get it very clear. It is interesting to note that on the Animate it website & Amazon page the image of the lens shows information written on the ring of the lens stating it's resolution and zoom, however, the camera in the kit does not have any of this printed information. I don't know if that indicates this has a different camera/lens or not, but it's definitely a poor quality one. The Hue camera also has a speaker built into the camera, so if you are doing audio voice over you're all set with the camera/microphone all-in-one.<br /><br />2. This Animate it kit comes with little plastic doo-hickeys (the OgoSport/OgoBild things) that you can create little creatures with as the subject of your animation. My daughter was not at all interested in these, preferring instead to use clay (our Hue kit from a couple years ago came with clay, but the newer ones seem not to anymore, and instead include a klutz animation book). This is just personal preference, but something to note. It seems to me that these plastic things might appeal to younger kids? My daughter is 11.<br /><br />3. The software, while adequate for most kids, isn't as comprehensive as the Hue animation software. It also doesn't have as good of instructions (video instructions for the Hue are really great and make each step to make animations very easy to figure out and do). My daughter was 8 when we first used the Hue kit and I did have to help her with some activities, especially some editing and splicing in music so the fade ins and outs were right where we wanted them, but once she got going she was very independent in creating her films.<br /><br />Some folks have mentioned that they don't feel the software with this Animate it kit is limited (it's called animate it express because it has less features than their fully fledged Animate it software) However, it doesn't offer all the features you can do on the Hue software, esp. related to editing, splicing in music, having different audio tracks, etc. It's just much more basic. Many kids may be happy with the more basic software, but once you've had more control and options for your animations it's hard to give some of that up.<br /><br />4. Price - the price of this kit is definitely less than the Hue kit, but also bear in mind that the Hue has a longer history and has won all kinds of awards, is used in schools, and overall has a much better camera and full featured software. I think if your kid is 10+, and/or really into animation they'll be much happier with the Hue kit. Younger kids may be just fine with this kit (although the camera will frustrate you no matter what your age).<br /><br />SUMMARY: Based on our experience with both this kit and the HUE kit, the HUE is the clear winner for overall quality and features (and I think for learning to use it, but that's subjective and others may feel the software for this Animate it kit is just as easy)ut that's subjective and others may feel the software for this Animate it kit is just as easy)|2015-08-31 |\n",

At first she didn't seem interested so I didn't push it. After sitting on her shelf for a couple of months, she finally expressed an interest in learning to start to sew. Upon opening it and going thru everything we decided to get started on the basic pouch so she could get used to the simple steps.<br /><br />The instructions were not clear enough for a nine year old to understand without lots of help from an adult. I would like to have seen &#34;kid friendly &#34; instructions included so she could feel more successful.<br /><br />The thread was very hard to get through the eye of the needle that was included in this kit, so I gave her a needle with a larger eye, from my sewing kit.<br /><br />After the beginning project, she was able to complete the stuffed animal projects with a little to no assistance from me.<br /><br />Although I do not sew as a hobby, this was a good place for my grand daughter to start exploring the sewing world and I think shes hooked!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |2015-08-31 |\n",

Then there is the rescan line that is smaller in scale- Blurr, bumblebee motorcycle, optimus monster truck, Boulder dump truck, Medix, Hoist.  The quality of the rescan size isn't as good as the energize bots, a bit more sticky in their movements.  Knowing this will save you some disappointment in quality and size.<br /><br />My boys love all things rescue bots and love the different sizes for different missions.  If you have the opportunity check these out in stores to see different styles, sizes and prices.<br /><br />The energize bots are easy enough for my 1-2 yr old.

She immediately started putting toys on top of &#34;her&#34; table - as obviously this was for her and NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE LOL!<br /><br /> She has had a little difficulty getting onto the chairs properly.  She is 32&#34; tall but her butt level is lower than the chair seat so she tries to &#34;scoot&#34; onto the chair and can only get a small part of her bum onto it.  Then as she tries to &#34;scoot&#34;onto the chair it pushes away from her.  The chairs are very light and even on an area rug move when she tries to get in them.  She has already learned to kind of half sit on the chair and wait for grandma & granddad to lift her the rest of the way onto the chair.  Her feet do not touch the floor when seated but she slides off the chair and hasn't had a problem on the dismount ha ha.  I think another inch or so of growth and the problem will be resolved.<br /><br />My Yorkie also loves the table as when my granddaughter is having lunch or her snack, he is right in feeding range - she does the one bite for you - one bite for the dog eating method - and they both enjoy this immensely.  I was going to try and tell her &#34;don't feed the dog&#34; but she has so much fun doing it I just can't tell her no (I would have never let my kids do this, but grandkids, that is a whole different story).<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice little table that doesn't take a lot of room and is easy to move inside and outside the house.  Works well as a play surface and can also be used for meals/snacks.  I was going to get a Little Tikes picnic table but decided to try this instead and am glad I did.  Picnic table wouldn't have been nearly as portable and would have taken a lot more space.  The two chairs fit completely under the table when not is use so great for anyone who wants a play table for their toddler with limited space.<br /><br />Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |2015-08-31 |\n",

You'll be prompted to install an update, then restart your pet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Very soft plush material<br />• Can be used on android or Apple devices<br /> - I have an iPhone & my husband has a Samsung and both worked well<br />• record & receive messages (your child can respond to you over the cloud)<br />• Extras in your child's menu:<br />  • lullabies (Ba-Ba Black Sheep, This Old Man, Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star, Welsh Lullaby) that have multiple settings<br />  • 5, 8, 10, 12, & 15 minutes<br />  • low, medium, high volume<br /> • 2 Read-A-Long stories<br />  • Barnyard Sounds game<br />  • Access your child's messages to send to your CloudPet<br /><br />Cons:<br />• needs more in-depth instructions or walk/through on the app for invite recipients<br />  - I helped my husband figure it out, but I'm pretty sure I'd need to show my mother or anyone else not as tech-savvy how to do it in person  (p.s. don't tell my mom I said that about her :) )<br />• You need to manually go into your child's menu in the app to send any messages you've recorded or that others have sent (this could also be a &#34;pro&#34;, but I was under the impression that if I sent it on my device while in Bluetooth range, it would send automatically)<br />• don't hold down the blue button too long while playing a message or it shorts out [perhaps] - you'll know if that's happened if you hear a feedback sound and the buttons are no longer responsive. ** this can be fixed by turning the CloudPet off, then back on again. Also easily avoided if you watch your kiddo with it & by not holding the button longer than necessary<br />• 10 second record time for mom/dad recording VS 18 seconds for your child to record a response. It would be nice to have an extended option for messages sent to child as well<br /><br />** If you are using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this; however, the application does not.<br /><br />My daughter and I are really enjoying this toy, as well as the rest of my family. I hope they come out with some additional updates soon, but I am just as equally pleased with what this product can do.<br /><br />* I purchased this product at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review<br /><br />I believe this product is of sound quality, but it does need a couple of small tweaks to make it closer to flawless.re using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this; however, the application does not.

It's intended for younger kids, but both my four year old and eight year old boys pretend play for hours with this.  It comes with food and accessories.<br /><br />It does really cool things and plays catchy little songs about pizza, bread, washing hands and so much more!  The sounds even teach counting. Along with all this is gives helpful baking tips and the number settings tell them the highter the number, the higher temp and what it's best to bake their items on. You put it on the correct number and it counts down until it's done..<br /><br />Think...holiday gift with this one!! you can't go wrong!!<br /><br />**I was sent this product in exchange for a honest review.

I was surprised at the fact I could keep it in the air without losing control or hitting a wall!  I have mastered landing it on my Remote Control Helicopter Landing pad!<br />Can be flown indoors or outdoors. When flying outdoors the wind may effect your flying as this helicopter is very light.<br />Has red and blue lights that flash which allows you to fly at night, pair it with a remote control helicopter landing pad and you have the perfect set up for night flying.<br />Flying time has ranged from 7 to 15 minutes for me, flying time is less outside depending on the breeze.<br />Very easy to control, although I have yet to master what every button on the remote does!

So that was pretty good.<br /><br />Ive just recently gotten back into collecting cards, but in my limited experience the cards did not seem damaged at all, no scratches or bends.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of what cards I received:<br /><br />108 total cards<br /><br />7 reverse foil cards (6 pokemon cards and 1 trainer card)<br />1 special energy card<br />100 other pokemon cards (basic+evolutions)<br /><br />3 non identical (from mixed sets, or with a reverse foil card)  triples (3 of same card)<br />7 identical pairs<br />5 non identical pairs<br />1 non identical quadruples<br /><br />No rare cards, rest are a mix of common and uncommon. My set had a range from squirtle (#7) to bergmite (#712)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2015-08-31 |\n",

Little bang for the buck.                 |Keeping everything in perspective, this expansion is average at best.  Do not buy this expansion based on hero and villain bits.  The quality of production is noticeably less than that which came with the original game.  The figures are smaller, and generally cheaper quality.  They don't even look to be on the same scale as those in the base game.  You get very little in regards to extra with this expansion.  What you do get is a continuation of the story, which is superb.  I repeat, do NOT expect nice figures to come with this expansion.  They do not mesh well with the base game in regards to appearance.  Really, they're quite ugly and cheap.  I would rate this expansion with less that 3 stars if based on bang for the buck value.  I give it 3 because of the story and the story alone.  In my opinion, PlaidHat put far more emphasis on the box than anything else.  The box is functionally useless since you'll end up storing all the components with the base game.  However the box is so pretty and sturdy.  You almost want to chuck the garbage figures that came with the expansion and re-purpose the box for something else.  Due to my lack luster impression of quality in this expansion, I will definitely not purchase any more in the series.  You can't sell a product based on a pretty box with inflated reviews....or maybe you can...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |2015-08-31 |\n",

She tore into it and did all the designs. We both noticed that the spinner wasn't really needed. I thought she had fun spinning it, but she claims not so much. She likes Qixels and it keeps her busy and entertained. I think it's a fun crafty toy for her age range. I think she would sooner have had more patterns and beads than the drier though.<br /><br />Bottom line: The kids love these kits. She will want more. They make a great gift for the age range.<br /><br />Notes from Sophie (11):<br />- You don't really need the drier and it's kinda loud<br />- Came with the same amount of designs and beads as a theme pack (4)<br />- You can do it without any parents help<br />- Can be used up quick<br />- There is a lot of packing trash<br />- A lot like Beados but squares

Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.  Frankly, I would have loved this toy as a child.  What the heck, I love this toy as an adult.  Then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Unfortunately we've been disappointed with it.<br /><br />1. The camera is definitely of lower quality, It does not have a weighted base but instead a suction cup, and the head of the camera (the end where all the functional stuff is and the lens) is much heavier, so it's quite top heavy. The suction cup is not a good idea as it doesn't make up for a weighted base, especially since it doesn't stick to many surfaces. We've not had any issues with the Hue camera falling over and luckily it does not have a suction cup, but the Animate it camera cannot stand on it's own and must be suction attached to something. The quality of the images the camera in this Animate it kit produces are not clear. The Hue camera can be focused directly by turning the lens, and while the camera on this kit has a lens that turns as well, we were not able to get it very clear. It is interesting to note that on the Animate it website & Amazon page the image of the lens shows information written on the ring of the lens stating it's resolution and zoom, however, the camera in the kit does not have any of this printed information. I don't know if that indicates this has a different camera/lens or not, but it's definitely a poor quality one. The Hue camera also has a speaker built into the camera, so if you are doing audio voice over you're all set with the camera/microphone all-in-one.<br /><br />2. This Animate it kit comes with little plastic doo-hickeys (the OgoSport/OgoBild things) that you can create little creatures with as the subject of your animation. My daughter was not at all interested in these, preferring instead to use clay (our Hue kit from a couple years ago came with clay, but the newer ones seem not to anymore, and instead include a klutz animation book). This is just personal preference, but something to note. It seems to me that these plastic things might appeal to younger kids? My daughter is 11.<br /><br />3. The software, while adequate for most kids, isn't as comprehensive as the Hue animation software. It also doesn't have as good of instructions (video instructions for the Hue are really great and make each step to make animations very easy to figure out and do). My daughter was 8 when we first used the Hue kit and I did have to help her with some activities, especially some editing and splicing in music so the fade ins and outs were right where we wanted them, but once she got going she was very independent in creating her films.<br /><br />Some folks have mentioned that they don't feel the software with this Animate it kit is limited (it's called animate it express because it has less features than their fully fledged Animate it software) However, it doesn't offer all the features you can do on the Hue software, esp. related to editing, splicing in music, having different audio tracks, etc. It's just much more basic. Many kids may be happy with the more basic software, but once you've had more control and options for your animations it's hard to give some of that up.<br /><br />4. Price - the price of this kit is definitely less than the Hue kit, but also bear in mind that the Hue has a longer history and has won all kinds of awards, is used in schools, and overall has a much better camera and full featured software. I think if your kid is 10+, and/or really into animation they'll be much happier with the Hue kit. Younger kids may be just fine with this kit (although the camera will frustrate you no matter what your age).<br /><br />SUMMARY: Based on our experience with both this kit and the HUE kit, the HUE is the clear winner for overall quality and features (and I think for learning to use it, but that's subjective and others may feel the software for this Animate it kit is just as easy)ut that's

As you spin her around the second level of the castle also raises up (or down if you're cranking the other way).  There are steps up the side that are spring loaded (when you touch the first step it flips the stairs over into a slide), an elsa portrait that turns around into a mirror, an Olaf portrait that is hidden behind a shade.  A drop down chandelier. Plus it comes with a few little accessories, day bed, makeup station/stool, and of course little items like goblets, chests, etc.<br /><br />Putting it together is fairly straightforward, some of the pieces are small and the directions aren't super clear, but it went together quite easily.  The best part is that you don't have to put any stickers on.<br /><br />So the final verdict.  It looks like Elsa's Ice Castle, it's quite huge and has a lot of room for playing with 12&#34; (i.e. Barbie size) dolls.  The downside that we see is some of the plastic pieces don't feel all that sturdy, and the weight of the chandelier portion really seems to tilt the castle a bit, kind of making it look like a large piece of cheap plastic toy.  Our daughter still loves it of course, but I feel it's really not justified of it's price tag.

It is, in fact, the only buildable toy I ever heard him threaten.  He told it, “If you don’t start walking, I am going to give you a low rating.”  Since I was the one who put the batteries in and closed up the compartment, I assumed it was my fault.  He went through and tested all of the parts until it worked.  I did like that it frustrated him a bit and he had to go all the way through to double check it.<br /><br />The parts to this are very creative.  They have colors and form and make me think of shape shifters.  I was just amazed by the way they fit together to make different animals and how graceful they were.<br /><br />This toy has already provided hours of entertainment and the boy read the directions after bedtime with a flashlight under his blankets.

This was a BIG hit for my daughter's 6th birthday.  She had a FurReal kitten when she was 4.5yrs old and she liked it for about a month and then every once in awhile it would wake up by accident (moving it) and she would spend another hour with it.  But for the most part it was demoted like Wheezy in Toy Story.  Collecting dust and mostly forgotten about.  But when I saw this option in my vine, I swore my daughter would love it.  Her favorite show is Mia and Me and it is filled with unicorns.  This one retails for $120 while her other FurReal was a $60 dollar item.  So this must be better.  And for the most part it is.  Beautiful eyes that blink with gorgeous eyelashes.  A rainbow main and tail.  Wings that move and flap slowly.  Her hoof moves, her horn lights up and her head moves.  She sings here and there and she eats her strawberry.  So why the 3 stars?  Well after a good solid 8 days of owning this, StarLily hasn't been touches in over 2 days.  Now, I can't say this will be the future, but thinking about my other FurReal demotion, it just may be.  The &#34;Oooh, ahhhh&#34; phase can be over pretty quick.  The promise this unicorn learns more and adapts to you seems like a bunch of baloney.  My daughter played with it for 6 days straight and there was nothing different.  And if her horn lights up green, my daughter would run and get the magic berry only to see the unicorn change back to another color.  Well, I guess it changed it's mind? she said.  Who knows.  And honestly, it's cute noises were annoying me after a few days.  I know, not a great mom but I couldn't help it.  There is no volume control.  Just an off and on button.  It takes four C batteries and so far so good.  But for my daughter, she rather play imagination and snuggle with a plain $7 Webkinz stuffed animal than play with this big unicorn that is hard and kinda heavy.  So if you are sure your daughter will have longevity with this and truly love and cherish it, than sure it may be worth it.  But for us, I would be really annoyed if I shelled out over a hundred dollars for a a few days of WOW.<br /><br />Update 10/13:  StarLily has officially been demoted.  I am not sure if it is just my daughter, her age (6), or the unicorn but the fact remains that there is very little interest in StarLily. The interest wore off quick.  I even put it out yesterday right by her Shopkins and she moved it out of the way to play.  Ouch!  I hope the other toys wake up at night and play with her because this unicorn is not getting any love.may be worth it.

No, really, your kids will LOVE this!                                                           |This is an awesome game! I have a 9 and a 5 year old and they just love playing this together or with their friends when they come over. It's just like in the movies where the action hero has to go through a passageway that is littered with lasers. The way this is implemented is pretty nice.<br /><br />You basically get a set of clamps with pulleys. You clamp the clamps to objects in your house, like a railing or coffee table. You then thread the laser line (string) through the pulleys and connect it to the bomb.  You then set the time on the bomb.  The participant (player) has to weave through the laser field without touching it. Everytime he touches the laser (the string) the sensor makes the countdown on the bomb go faster!  This penalizes players who are sloppy and touch the line. The goal is to get across the laser field and to deactivate the bomb before the time runs out.<br /><br />To make things more interesting you have two additional elements:<br /><br />1) The game has object cards that have flashlights, earpiece, camera et. If you want to add complexity to the game, players can be required to pick those up those item (the cards) as they make their way through the laser field before they get to the end.....you can put the cards in particularly tough spots to make sure nobody takes the easy path through the laser field.<br /><br />2) You can also put down up to two mission cards. Using an App that you can download (IPhone or Android) the player has to go through the game with their phone and when they get to the Mission Card, they have to scan it and then they have to complete the mission on the phone successfully before continuing on....all of this eats up time.<br /><br />Overall, my girls love this game.  I showed them the [[ASIN:B001GPOSYC Get Smart [Blu-ray]]] scene where they have to go through the laser field. You can get the movie or just type &#34;Get Smart laser and mouse&#34; into Google and they can see the scene on YouTube -- that's all they'll need.<br /><br />Overall, tons of fun for kids from 7 on up.l need.<br /><br />Overall, tons of fun for kids from 7 on up.

A real bargain.

In fact, let me get right to it -- this is an incredible bargain and Amazon currently has the lowest price I could find anywhere ($24.99).<br /><br />This thing is solid, very well designed, and most importantly, it works very well with a clear image and many nice features. Dual lighting (above and below the stage), and good lenses (a first, in my experience, for plastic lenses). The unit is very light and easy to carry around (you'll need to find your own case, though, as none is included, but that's OK with me at this low price).<br /><br />I love that this thing looks like a real microscope. Back when I was a kid, I got a first &#34;student&#34; microscope that was of very good quality and I had years and years of fun with it and feel that it helped spark my interest in nature, science, and the fascinating world around us. This scope may do the same for your young, budding scientist.<br /><br />The microscope is easy to use and has good lighting, much better than many others I've seen. I also found this one much easier to focus than some. Again, the image is sharp and clear and a delight at this very low price. It comes with some accessories and a few prepared slides, but I would advise purchasing a small set of good prepared slides so your young one has a better variety of interesting things to look at right away (kids are often impatient as we know). [See below]<br /><br />*** Do not hesitate-- buy this for that young one and open them up to a new world of wonder!<br /><br />Update: You can search here on Amazon for many more, but here are a few sets of prepared slides you might consider to go with this 'scope:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0055DZ3EK AmScope PS25 Prepared Microscope Slide Set for Basic Biological Science Education, 25 Slides, Includes

After all, it came out in late May and it arrived in late July. However, they (and Paizo apparently) really wanted me to cover the game for them in the same manner that I covered the original Rise of the Runelords and its expansions. I’ll admit that even though I own all of Rise of the Runelords, I didn’t think the game was good enough to get a second set (Skulls & Shackles, much less a third. It was a fun but heavily flawed game with a really poorly written instruction manual and cards that often time just seemed thrown together to make a set without any flow or cohesion. Worst of all, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game was like many Paizo releases – very overpriced for what you get coupled with a constant nickel and diming of their fan base.<br /><br />To complete an Adventure Card Game Set you’ll need the box set and the next five deck releases. That’s $120 just to complete the storyline. If you want the extra characters AND the ability to have more than four players take part, that’s an extra $20. Add in the MSRP $60 price tag for the base set and that means to finish any Pathfinder Adventure Card Game set, you are shilling out $200. That’s insane, especially for a card game. Even games with extremely detailed miniatures and large boards don’t cost that much. In truth, Paizo should be including the “Character Add-On Pack” with the core game and the price of the card decks should be $10-15. The MSRP on these are insane and unfortunately, much like the actual tabletop products Paizo releases, this is par for the course. You can generally get better written, better made and cheaper in cost releases from contemporaries. However, Paizo is one of the big two in the tabletop industry and so they can get away with this. It’s disheartening, but at least this games sell poorly enough that you can wait a year and get the baseset for $20. That’s what I did with Skull and Shackles. I hate being this negative at the start of a review but for people who are brand new to Pathfinder (or Paizo’s business practices), you should be aware that the price tag attached to the base set is only a fraction of what you’ll actually pay.<br /><br />Now that this is out of the way, we can spend the rest of the review being positive. Compared to Rise of the Runelords, Wrath of the Righteous is proof that you can learn from your (many) mistakes. Not only is the base set’s rulebook cleaned up and easier for newcomers to follow, but mechanics and card verbiage are tightened up as well. There is also a new mechanic called Redemption where you can removed the Corrupted trait from a card for the rest of, not just the current Scenario you are in, but for the full Adventure Path. That’s really neat and gives you more of a continuity than just your character card getting checked off as you complete Scenarios/Adventures.<br /><br />Other examples of new options in Wrath of the Righteous include Cohorts which gives some characters an extra card in their starting hand. This is no small bonus as cards are your Hit Points in this game as well as your actions, so anything that gives you an extra one to your deck or hand is nothing to take lightly. Of course the drawback is that if you ever banish your Cohort, it is gone FOREVER. You have to go through the Adventure Path without it. So try not to lose it. The other new concept introduced with Wrath of the Righteous is the Mythic Path. In Rise of the Runelords, as you advanced through the game, you could earn one of two Prestige Classes which would give new powers and bonuses to your character. With Wrath of the Righteous you still have this , but you will also gain access to one of six Mythic Paths. Each of these paths enables you to store up Mythic Charges and expend them in special ways. You get to choose which of the paths you want, so it doesn’t HAVE to match up exactly with your character’s stats, but synergy, min/max’ing is a staple of any version of Pathfinder, so you’ll find it a lot easier to get through the game if you give your Dwarven Ranger say, Mythic Guardian instead of Mythic Archmage.<br /><br />Other than some new rules and cleaned up mechanics, Wrath of the Righteous plays exactly like Rise of the Runelords. You complete Adventures, which are broken down into scenarios. Each Add-On Pack (including the one in the Base Set) contains one full adventure, which is made of up six scenarios. A scenario will be a play session that last you between fifteen minutes and one hour, depending on the number of players and how much you discuss your actions as a team. The more players you have, the more you have to explore so sometimes less players makes for an easier time and vice versa. It just depends on the characters you pick and the current scenario you are in.<br /><br />You have seven character options in Wrath of the Righteous and another four in the Add-On Pack. If you have the previous releases you CAN use the characters from those games, but they might not work as well simply because the game is geared for the characters in this set. Still the flexibility is nice. I personally usually go for Harsk the Dwarven Ranger as he is the most balanced in the game, but for Wrath of the Righteous my character was Seelah the Paladin. I figured since Wrath of the Righteous was demon-oriented, a holy warrior who could heal and kick butt was a good option. My wife, who has never played any version of Pathfinder before chose Enora, the Halfing (She kept calling her character a Kender though, being a 1e Dragonlance lady) Arcanist. This was my first time playing a Pathfinder Adventure Card Game with only two players (I have done more and solo play), but I found the game to work really well with just two PCs. Perhaps it is the refined rules or maybe it was the character tandem we chose, but I found Wrath of the Righteous to be a much easier experience in terms of vetting the rules and also going through the game. My wife said she found the game to be “complicated but fun” and something she wouldn’t mind trying again, but she does prefer other card games like Batman Fuxx or the  DC Super Heroes Deck Building Games. In terms of RPG style board games she did prefer ones like The Legend of Drizzt and Conquest of Nerath. I should point out both of those games are cheaper than Wrath of the Righteous and offer far more replay value too. That makes me (her?) sound like a D&D shill but those are the RPG style boardgames she prefers.<br /><br />Setting up the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game takes a long time, regardless of set. You have to sort out all of the cards into types, then get out your scenario card. After that you did through the locations to set up the right spots needed for this scenario. Then you create a deck for each location based on their cards lists. You shuffle each deck of each type, create a location deck and then shuffle that. Then you add in the Big Bad and its henchmen and shuffle once more. Depending on your rolls, setup can take longer than the actual scenario itself. Considering there are only six scenarios to a pack, this means you have a game that takes up a lot of room but doesn’t take long to play. Even worse, because each scenario is meant to be played in a specific order and cannot be replayed when finished (no grinding here!), the replay value on any PACG set is abysmally low. Unless of course you want to count starting the game over from scratch, which is certainly doable, but that’s like replaying a tabletop adventure and that never works out well when you have the exact same people involved. So if a lack of replay and high cost sound like pretty good deterrents to picking up Wrath of the Righteous, you probably shouldn’t.<br /><br />What is nice though is that unlike previous box sets, you get a full adventure in addition to the first adventure pack in Wrath of the Righteous. That’s another five adventures not connected to the core storyline where you can learn the basics of the game, grind up a bit before moving on to the actual Adventure Path and hopefully improve your deck/stats. Wrath of the Reighteous had this, but you only had two or three extra scenarios while Wrath of the Righteous gives you that full set. That’s a nice bonus and shows Paizo has learned to give customers a little more for their money.<br /><br />After everything is finally set up, you’re final able to start playing. You and your allied will go through each location deck, with the goal being to “close” out the location. You do that by going through all the cards in the deck or by finding/defeating the Henchmen in the deck. Once you are down to a single location, that means there is only the Boss left. Now you can encounter the boss prior to this, but if you beat them, they run away again and again until there is only the one location deck left, meaning they are at their final stand. As you go through each deck you’ll turn over cards. Some will be cards you can acquire and add to your own collection, like spells, armor, weapons and items. Others will be cards you have to defeat/disable, like traps and monsters. To acquire or fight, there will be a target number on the card. You must achieve this number or higher by rolling a die and adding in any bonuses you get to said roll. The type of die you roll is based on the check you must make and your character. For example, in my games with my wife, my Paladin had a d10 to her Charisma, meaning she was very good at getting Ally cards. My wife’s character could only roll a d8 in Charisma checks. This meant I had a higher rate of success with Charisma based rolls. Meanwhile her character had a d12 Intelligence while mine only had a d4 so obviously we know who is going to be better there… A good way to ensure you will succeed is that your characters complement each other. Ifall you have are a thief and a fighter, you’ll be good at battles and traps, but if an Arcane check comes up, you’re pretty much dead. The same is true if you take say, a Sorcerer and a Wizard. Strength checks will not be your friend.<br /><br />As you take damage, you will lose cards from your deck. Once your deck is gone, you are dead. So it’s a matter of keeping your deck replenished while also battling the clock to ensure you find and defeat the boss before the Blessings Deck runs out. The Blessings deck is essentially a timer. If you beat the Scenario, you can see what kind of bonus you get for winning. It might be a permanent power-up to your character or an item. Then you can remake your deck and play another Scenario or call it quits for the day and go through the long clean-up process. Again, there is a VERY good chance that you’ll spend more time setting things up and tearing them down than you actually do playing the game, but at least the game is a lot of fun while you’re in the scenario.<br /><br />So checks and balances with Wrath of the Righteous. It’s definitely overpriced compared to other options out there, especially when you factor in having to buy a lot of extras to make the game complete. There isn’t a lot of replay value and setting up/tearing down takes a lot of time. At the same time, the game is a lot of fun and the randomness means even if you do start over and replay some scenarios, it will be different each time. The rules are the best they have ever been and it’s a fine alternative to traditional roleplaying games. The same Adventure Path in tabletop form costs a lot more than the card game version and you do need four to six people to play every step of the way with that or your characters will die horribly. The card game version of Wrath of the Righteous is very well balanced (perhaps too easy compared to the first two games) and solo play means you can have fun even if no one else is around. At the end of the day youhave to decide if you want to invest the full $200 or not into this game. There are a lot of better options for the price point. Comparing just the base sets, I’d go with the upcoming Warhammer Quest card game from Fantasy Flight over this. As well if you look at the full cost of playing this game from beginning to end, I’d rather go with Cthulhu Wars by Petersen Games which offers far more replayability and some fantastic miniatures for use with the game. If you’re a big Pathfinder fan though, the card game version is far more flexible than the traditional RPG version, costs a lot less and offers the aforementioned solo play. So there are a lot of positives, but also a lot of negatives when you look at Wrath of the Righteous critically. You just have to decide which side outweighs the other when it comes to your specific tastes and needs.|2015-08-26 |\n",

One thing I forgot to mention last time, is to get extra arrows, which are here:  [[ASIN:B00INZO35W Nerf Rebelle Secrets & Spies Arrow Refill Pack]]  You get 3 darts in a refill pack, and although they retail for about 10 bucks, you can catch them on sale for about $6, especially around the holidays.  I'll be honest, though, even at $10, I'd still get them because it makes it so much more fun to have more darts, and also I keep an extra pack hidden away for when one ends up on a roof or in the woods!  Hope this update helps someone.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Lots of kids live in our neighborhood, so when I get a toy to review, I really like to let them be my official little toy-testers, led of course by my own kids.  While adults can give great feedback and definitely spot problems, there's nothing like the true field-test with a bunch of kids.<br /><br />Even though the arrows fall out of the quiver, and the sight isn't really helpful, none of that matters because this Nerf Bow and Arrow is super-fun!  We also have the [[ASIN:B00EAHXOWA Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow Blaster]] which is a blast, too!  The Rebelle is marketed to girls (girls are in the pictures using it, pink is part of the color scheme, although it blends in great with the blue and purple hues), but the boys had so much fun using it that they didn't care at all that Nerf sets it up as a girl's toy.<br /><br />UNBOXING the bow and arrow was a bit difficult because the ties holding the parts to the cardboard were very thick, difficult to cut, and attached without any wiggle room to wedge the scissors in.  Once we got through that, though, it was time to ASSEMBLE the bow.  The instructions were easy to understand, with lots of illustrations, and it went together relatively easily.<br /><br />This part is kind of funny.  Nerf calls it the &#34;high-tech auto-feed quiver,&#34;  but there is nothing high-tech or automatic about the quiver.  When we put the arrows in the quiver, half of them promptly fell out.  The trick is to tilt the bow back like you're shooting at the sky.  That way when you put the arrows in the quiver they won't just flop out on the floor.  The way it's supposed to work is that you pull the trigger and it releases an arrow into the arrow bay, which is what they call the area that holds the arrow before you launch it.  Many times this will work the way it's supposed to.  Many times it won't.<br /><br />Once the arrow is in the arrow bay, then you &#34;nock&#34; the back end of the arrow into the string.  This just means that you tuck the string into the notch at the back end of the arrow.  Then you pull the arrow back, aim using the sight...surprise surprise, the sight isn't accurate, or even very close, but once you figure out what direction and how much it's off by, you can make the adjustment yourself.  Since you can have tons of fun without exactly aiming it through a sight but instead sending it off in the direction you want it to go, the sight isn't a big deal.<br /><br />Did it have a screw loose?  Did I have a screw loose?  It turns out no, but some may argue the point.<br />Let me save you TONS of time by telling you this:  the instructions refer to a screw that you need to use when you put the bow together.  Not having come across a screw when I very carefully unboxed this, I thought maybe it flew out of the packaging so I searched the chair, the floor, the packaging, and the area around.  Complicating things further, there was a small plastic piece in the packaging that looked perfect for holding a small screw, but alas, it was empty, too.  Right when I figured my best option was to find another screw that would fit it, or possibly use what might seem like an unnecessary screw in any of the other 10-12 Nerf things we have around, I looked very closely into the recessed area where the screw was supposed to go.  Guess what I saw?  Yes, it turns out that Nerf already put the screw in, and all I needed to do is tighten it!  I should have known that Nerf would be more logical than most other toy companies.  It was smart and the only thing that would have been smarter would be if they mentioned in the instructions that the screw that needs tightened is already in it!  But that's a minor thing, and certainly not a negative about the bow.<br /><br />As you can tell from this review, the Nerf Rebelle Bow & Arrow set were a huge hit with kids and adults alike.  I sure hope that this review helps someone make a choice.Nerf already put the screw in, and all I needed to do is tighten it!

His mom shares these comments:<br /><br />* He loves the Thomas toy however it's incredibly loud.<br />* The thing is very unstable in its movements and constantly falls over.<br />* The packaging was very large which was strange to me but the train took up kind of a small amount of it so nothing like giant advertising for a relatively small train.  However I was able to grab a hold of It and basically rip it out of the box in one fell swoop so you could say that it was pretty frustration free packaging.<br />* In an afterthought they should've made some kind of volume switch so that it didn't have to be so loud because even he says that he's very loud.<br />* The cats hate it.<br />* It doesn't always seem to be able to flip over the way it's supposed to and I also should point out that the light that is supposed to be shining out in front of it is very dim and  and doesn't show up. I saw on the box that it was supposed to do that but for the longest time we didn't think that that feature even worked because we couldn't notice it.<br /><br />But hey! It's Thomas and it makes noise :) It's not meant to make mom or the cats happy. 4-stars because he likes it, even though the adults might rate it lower if it were for them.

Over the years I've collected figurines made by Schleich, Papo, and Safari LTD (from downunder), and though all are good, Schleich are IMO the highest quality overall. According to Wikipedia, Schleich figurines are handpainted in China and produced at the Schleich German headquarters as well as in foreign production facilities. I own quite a few Schleich figurines and I've yet to see one that was poorly handpainted or that appeared to be poorly manufactured.<br /><br />My 5 year old grandson loves all the figurines I own (by Schleich, Papo, and Safari, LTD), and they obviously spark his imagination, and he can literally play with them by himself for hours at a time.<br /><br />This dragon is part of Schleich's 2015 Eldrador Knights line. (Visit Schleich dot com as well as Eldrador dot com for a full tour of their fine products.)<br /><br />The Eldrador Dragon Fighter is incredibly detailed, as my photos hopefully show. From the tip of it's nose to the tip of its tail it measures about 8&#34;, and its wingspan is about 8 1/2&#34;. It weighs 4.88 ounces or 138.5 grams on my digital kitchen scale. The dragon's jaw moves up and down, though fairly slightly (the jaw is open all the way on the dragon in my photos). Some children may need to be cautioned to not force the jaw on this dragon.<br /><br />Though made of plastic, there are pointy parts on this figurine that could definitely hurt if accidentally poked into an eye, etc.<br /><br />This Schleich figurine, like all the figurines they produce, is heirloom quality. Of course they can be played with but they can also be displayed and admired.<br /><br />Whenever I have my eye on a particular Schleich figurine offered on Amazon (by Amazon itself or a marketplace seller), I put it in my cart and wait until the price drops to a level I'm comfortable with. If you are into these kinds of figurines, you cannot go wrong with Schleich.ong with Schleich.

The toy is large enough to sit or stand inside with plenty of room and its wide design makes it surprisingly stable and tip-resistant. My son is amazed that the toy responds with a simple touch of the bar and this toy holds his attention for quite some time, which is a feat for any toy at his age. The ball ramp and spinning toys along the bottom are forgotten at this stage (they're better appreciated by a younger baby who cannot yet stand, I'm sure) but there's plenty going on on the light bar to keep him entertained. One small gripe is that there is nowhere to store the balls. In the photo it looks as though they store on the ramp but this is just photographic trickery as the balls continue to roll out the other side (take a peek at all of the stock photos to see what I mean).<br /><br />Also worth noting: this product requires four size C batteries and they are NOT included. Kids' toys are a crapshoot these days whether or not they'll come with batteries pre-installed. Usually when batteries need to be purchased separately it is so indicated in the product listing and there was no mention of this on this product's page. This was a small annoyance (especially since we didn't realize we needed to buy batteries until we had this thing halfway unboxed) but not a deal breaker by any means.<br /><br />Overall I'm impressed with this toy. My son enjoys stage two right now so I know there is a good deal of play ahead with stage 3. I love these multi-stage toys that grow with your child with the flip of a switch.

I now purchase about ten games a year and I am always looking to try out something new. I try to pick up any new games that I can to give them a spin, and this game looked to be quite a bit different from other games I currently own. Most of my games are strategy games, hidden role games, card drafting games, miniatures games, or assorted types of party games. I have very few spatial orienting or dexterity games, so this was truly something new for me to try. So, after a couple of plays, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1. Components: Quality is high. The plastic balls have a nice heft to them and are surely sturdy enough to stand up to many plays and falls. All of the cardboard components are plenty thick and were cleanly cut so it was easy to punch out the pieces of each. The cards are printed on a high-quality stock of paper. Instructions are clear, illustrated, and free of errors. My very slight complaint about the components is this: I wish there were a few more small plastic baggies included in the box so that I could sort the many small cardboard components and store them all separate from one another. I happened to have a few small plastic zip-lock bags left over from another game so I was still able to sort them as I wished, but it would have been nice to have a few of these included.<br /><br />2. Mechanics: This game features some interesting mechanics. The game is all about proper positioning of the colored balls: which color is touching which, how many you can use, where things must go or where they can't go. All of this takes place under the impetus of time, too. This game has little to do with strategy or deduction, yet it is very analytical in nature. There is always a best way to accomplish your tasks, but figuring out what that way is under a short time constraint makes the game more fun (or more frustrating - depending on how your brain works). The game is very easy to learn, yet can be difficult to master.<br /><br />3. Fun: I found this game to be entertaining, yet it isn't one I am likely to pull out very often. My son liked it pretty well, but the other three members of my family didn't care for it. They found it too difficult and pretty much resigned themselves to losing the game every time they play it. They did not find it fun and will not want to play it again anytime soon. Because of this, I had to give it a lower rating. Though it could still be categorized as a family game, I kind of think you'd have a hard time finding too many households where everyone would like it. This game definitely appeals to certain types of people, and - unfortunately - most of the members of my family are not that type of family. Since two of us thought it was OK and three of us didn't like it, this one may not stay in my collection for long.e difficult to master.<br /><br />3.

It encourages development of fine motor skills and enhances imaginative play.  We love the wagon, it enables easy clean up that our daughter can do all by herself.  She's two years old and can easily pull this all by herself.  It does not always pick up the bloks, but that doesn't bother us.<br /> At the same time, the wagon is light enough, that we do not worry about it rolling on her toes or its weight  overpowering her.<br />The plastic used in the wagon and blocks are smooth and brightly colored. It is thick and sturdy, with its quality, it is something you can pass on to other kids.  A must have toy that has no batteries! We love it.

Go! Smart Wheels Ultimate racetrack is a wonderful playset for a small child.  Both my 7 year old and my 2 year old have had a lot of fun with this toy.<br /><br />PACKAGING:  The packaging is not the easiest to handle.  A sharp blade will be needed to cut out several of the larger pieces from the packaging.<br /><br />SET-UP:  Set-up isn't too bad.  Applying all the decals is the most time consuming step.  The manual is printed so small that it makes it very difficult to see.  Otherwise, the physical pieces look so different from each other that it is easy to identify which piece needs to be snapped into the others.<br /><br />PLAYTIME:  The kids love it, especially the two year old.  He would jump up and down saying &#34;whheee&#34; and &#34;go!&#34;.  The seven year old seemed more interested in placing obstructions on the track to see what would happen when the car hit them.<br /><br />Creating the track is simple and several examples are provided in the instructions.  The pieces are stable and click together sufficiently.  There are several areas of interest on the track itself including:<br />-  A gas station where the car will pass, sounds will emanate that the car is out of gas, it will back up to the pump, and then continue after the refill.<br />-  There is a tower of clock-work gears that will activate when the car drives over the gear on the track.  The car pauses for a moment while all the gears turn.  Every time the two year old will say &#34;Wow!&#34; when this happens... he doesn't seem to tire of it.<br />-  The tilting track piece that uses gravity to roll on the hinges when the car passes over.  This is one way only.<br />-  The elevator.  The car will drive onto the platform and pause while the platform is raised to the top where the car continues.<br />-  The switch junction.  If the track is assembled a certain way, you can make the switch junction alternate paths each time around.<br />-  The flag arches where the car will hit a dangling flag that will cause it to swing back and forth.<br /><br />The remote itself has two buttons (go forward, go reverse) and a three way switch.  The car also has the three way switch.  The three way switch corresponds to off, on, and motor.  Both the remote and the car must on the same setting to work properly.  This is confusing to an adult, so it would not be reasonable to expect a child to operate this part of the toy.  One setting allows the car to be driven on any surface and the other on the track (motor, maybe?).  I can never remember which is which.  Also, if the device is left on the battery will continue to drain.  This caused our new batteries to drain after only two days of play, so always remember to turn both the remote and the car to 'off' after use.<br /><br />The audio and sounds from the car, either on the track or off, are very age appropriate and varied.  While on the track, the car will speak about the different sections of track and not the same thing each time.  While off the track the audio is more limited but still varied.  The volume is perfect; some toys can be too loud but the Vtech Go! hits the sweet spot.<br /><br />STORAGE:  You better have some extra room to store this racetrack.  The smaller flat track pieces will pose no problem and take up little space.  But there are several larger pieces that are going to take up a large footprint in a cabinet or closet, so you may want to think ahead about storage.<br /><br />OVERALL:  Bravo!  We love it.  This is a great toy and is well engineered with quality plastic pieces.  It should hold up well to the abuse of young children.  There are no sharp edges and every angle has been smoothed and curved.  It's offered enough functional variety to offer longevity as a favorite toy.itself has two buttons (go forward, go reverse) and a three way switch.  The car also has the three way switch.

In my seven years of writing for The Chocolate Cult I've tested all sorts of chocolate and chocolate making accessories so when the Amazon Vine program offered me the chance to test this kit I was thrilled to do so. I've used silicone molds to make my own chocolate pieces and another chocolate bar making kit in the past so I naturally made some comparisons between those products and this one from Moose Toys. I'll highlight the unique tools in this kit.<br /><br />This kit comes with a tool you use to melt the chocolate in and to pour the chocolate from called the Squeezer. It melts chocolate well and it also provides a lot of control over where you pour the chocolate but it is impossible to get all of the chocolate out of it so you still end up spooning or scraping some of the chocolate out. Real chocolate is not cheap so you will want to use every bit that you can.<br /><br />The molds -- two large and two small -- are very similar to ones I've used in the past but these make very thick, over two inches if you fill them fully up, bars compared to previous molds and kits I've used. The inserts for the small molds can add 6 different textures that show up best in white or very light milk chocolate bars. The inserts add one more piece of silicone you have to peel off of your chocolate before eating.<br /><br />The &#34;menu&#34; of possible added ingredients is very visual but didn't really give details on how you might melt caramel or what type of peanut butter to you. You'd have to experiment to find out what works and what doesn't. I used caramel, goji berries, cacao nibs, and graham cracker crumbs in my testing and they all worked fairly well. Be careful with caramel because it gets very hot and then gets very hard once the bars are formed. You can also layer with different types of chocolate -- I used white, 47%, 56% and 70% chocolate in my testing. You do not need to follow the directions in terms of temperature of your microwave for melting; lowest setting takes a lot time, go for a higher setting and you'll save a lot of time.<br /><br />Frankly the 4 wrappers are really just bags that seal and the four labels are basic. 4 seems like far too little to really be worth very much. Once you start working with chocolate you'll want to keep going; I ended up making 14 bars in 2 hours and 40 minutes (I'll add a photo to show you what I made). I checked the kit's website and they do not seem to sell extra wrappers and labels so These seem unnecessary to me.<br /><br />If you have kids, I'd recommend one of these kits per child to save time and cut back on arguing over who uses which mold, which insert, and who gets to handle the squeezer. It isn't very expensive and all of the tools (except the bags/tags) can be washed and reused over and over again. Note that you have to wash these by hand and I found that a soft brush worked much better than a dish cloth for the molds and inserts but that the squeezer needs a dishcloth and very thing to clean the nozzle part of it.need to follow the directions in terms of temperature of your microwave for melting; lowest setting takes a lot time, go for a higher setting and you'll save a lot of time.<br /><br />Frankly the 4 wrappers are really just bags that seal and the four labels are basic. 4 seems like far too little to really be worth very much.

I thought this was a small toy, but it is actual a large stationary playset for a child to crawl inside and play with.  There are shapes they can fit into the slots on the doors, and the steering wheel console activates lights and sounds.  The interior of the car is tight, and won't really fit a 3 year old, even though the age rating on the box says 6 months to 36 months.  I think the max age a kid will enjoy this is under 2 years.  If your child cannot stand on his own yet, then they will get a kick out of crawling in and out of it, and pulling themselves up.  My son is 19 months old, and I think the space is too small for him.  There is no seat inside, and the kids just sit on the ground.  My son walks around the car, and sits down and plays with the shapes.  He is enjoying playing inside now and turns the wheel and moves the shifters around.  He probably goes in and plays with it for 5 minutes and then comes back out.  His attention span is probably shorter than mine. However, since it is a stationary toy, and he is a toddler on the move, it just does not entertain him so much.  I think if I had gotten this when he started crawling, he would have had more fun out of it.  If you want to get your money's worth, I would definitely recommend getting this while they are first learning to crawl and pull themselves up.  The car is very easy to assemble and had about 21 screws.  You just need a Philips screwdriver to assemble.  The rest of the pieces just snap on.  You will also have to apply the stickers on there.  The plastic is soft, but bendable, but not easily breakable.  It's a fun play set designed for young ones.  Again, I would recommend getting it early so you can get your money's worth out of it.

As you can see in the video I go from never having seen one to riding it comfortably in ten minutes.  The hardest part about learning to ride it was that all the neighbor kids wanted a turn!  I really was enjoying it until I was able to get it above a few miles an hour, then I felt the slight rub on the right wheel that became worse at increased speeds.  Then after charging it a second time I began to have issues with the battery.  Every time I rode for more than five minutes the red battery light started blinking and the warning alarm buzzed.  I'd recharge it then try to ride it but then it started buzzing after riding it for three minutes.  So I contacted the Leray people through the warranty card in the box: they immediately emailed me a return UPS label and as soon as they received my scooter they sent me a new one.  Seamless.<br /><br />The new one works fine: it charged up in under an hour and I rode for an hour this afternoon.  It's really addictive!  If you want to have some fun, I highly recommend getting one these scooters.<br /><br />PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.)

At first she didn't seem interested so I didn't push it. After sitting on her shelf for a couple of months, she finally expressed an interest in learning to start to sew. Upon opening it and going thru everything we decided to get started on the basic pouch so she could get used to the simple steps.<br /><br />The instructions were not clear enough for a nine year old to understand without lots of help from an adult. I would like to have seen &#34;kid friendly &#34; instructions included so she could feel more successful.<br /><br />The thread was very hard to get through the eye of the needle that was included in this kit, so I gave her a needle with a larger eye, from my sewing kit.<br /><br />After the beginning project, she was able to complete the stuffed animal projects with a little to no assistance from me.<br /><br />Although I do not sew as a hobby, this was a good place for my grand daughter to start exploring the sewing world and I think shes hooked!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2015-08-31 |\n",

I'm not sure where all these tiny cats are that they sell cat tubes for, but it's a little ridiculous. They love it!, with clips you can bend it into different shapes or connect the tunnels. It's Huge, so make sure you have room for it, but the cats love to chase each other through it at high speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

Then there is the rescan line that is smaller in scale- Blurr, bumblebee motorcycle, optimus monster truck, Boulder dump truck, Medix, Hoist.  The quality of the rescan size isn't as good as the energize bots, a bit more sticky in their movements.  Knowing this will save you some disappointment in quality and size.<br /><br />My boys love all things rescue bots and love the different sizes for different missions.  If you have the opportunity check these out in stores to see different styles, sizes and prices.<br /><br />The energize bots are easy enough for my 1-2 yr old.  Some of the rescan size can frustrate my 1-2 yr old but my 3-4 yr old has no problem transforming them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

She immediately started putting toys on top of &#34;her&#34; table - as obviously this was for her and NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE LOL!<br /><br /> She has had a little difficulty getting onto the chairs properly.  She is 32&#34; tall but her butt level is lower than the chair seat so she tries to &#34;scoot&#34; onto the chair and can only get a small part of her bum onto it.  Then as she tries to &#34;scoot&#34;onto the chair it pushes away from her.  The chairs are very light and even on an area rug move when she tries to get in them.  She has already learned to kind of half sit on the chair and wait for grandma & granddad to lift her the rest of the way onto the chair.  Her feet do not touch the floor when seated but she slides off the chair and hasn't had a problem on the dismount ha ha.  I think another inch or so of growth and the problem will be resolved.<br /><br />My Yorkie also loves the table as when my granddaughter is having lunch or her snack, he is right in feeding range - she does the one bite for you - one bite for the dog eating method - and they both enjoy this immensely.  I was going to try and tell her &#34;don't feed the dog&#34; but she has so much fun doing it I just can't tell her no (I would have never let my kids do this, but grandkids, that is a whole different story).<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice little table that doesn't take a lot of room and is easy to move inside and outside the house.  Works well as a play surface and can also be used for meals/snacks.  I was going to get a Little Tikes picnic table but decided to try this instead and am glad I did.  Picnic table wouldn't have been nearly as portable and would have taken a lot more space.  The two chairs fit completely under the table when not is use so great for anyone who wants a play table for their toddler with limited space.<br /><br />Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2015-08-31 |\n",

You install the app and once you've created an account, it walks you through it. You'll be prompted to install an update, then restart your pet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Very soft plush material<br />• Can be used on android or Apple devices<br /> - I have an iPhone & my husband has a Samsung and both worked well<br />• record & receive messages (your child can respond to you over the cloud)<br />• Extras in your child's menu:<br />  • lullabies (Ba-Ba Black Sheep, This Old Man, Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star, Welsh Lullaby) that have multiple settings<br />  • 5, 8, 10, 12, & 15 minutes<br />  • low, medium, high volume<br /> • 2 Read-A-Long stories<br />  • Barnyard Sounds game<br />  • Access your child's messages to send to your CloudPet<br /><br />Cons:<br />• needs more in-depth instructions or walk/through on the app for invite recipients<br />  - I helped my husband figure it out, but I'm pretty sure I'd need to show my mother or anyone else not as tech-savvy how to do it in person  (p.s. don't tell my mom I said that about her :) )<br />• You need to manually go into your child's menu in the app to send any messages you've recorded or that others have sent (this could also be a &#34;pro&#34;, but I was under the impression that if I sent it on my device while in Bluetooth range, it would send automatically)<br />• don't hold down the blue button too long while playing a message or it shorts out [perhaps] - you'll know if that's happened if you hear a feedback sound and the buttons are no longer responsive. ** this can be fixed by turning the CloudPet off, then back on again. Also easily avoided if you watch your kiddo with it & by not holding the button longer than necessary<br />• 10 second record time for mom/dad recording VS 18 seconds for your child to record a response. It would be nice to have an extended option for messages sent to child as well<br /><br />** If you are using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this; however, the application does not.<br /><br />My daughter and I are really enjoying this toy, as well as the rest of my family.

It's intended for younger kids, but both my four year old and eight year old boys pretend play for hours with this.  It comes with food and accessories.<br /><br />It does really cool things and plays catchy little songs about pizza, bread, washing hands and so much more!  The sounds even teach counting. Along with all this is gives helpful baking tips and the number settings tell them the highter the number, the higher temp and what it's best to bake their items on.

I was surprised at the fact I could keep it in the air without losing control or hitting a wall!  I have mastered landing it on my Remote Control Helicopter Landing pad!<br />Can be flown indoors or outdoors. When flying outdoors the wind may effect your flying as this helicopter is very light.<br />Has red and blue lights that flash which allows you to fly at night, pair it with a remote control helicopter landing pad and you have the perfect set up for night flying.<br />Flying time has ranged from 7 to 15 minutes for me, flying time is less outside depending on the breeze.<br />Very easy to control, although I have yet to master what every button on the remote does! I just press the buttons, push the joys stick in every which direction and go! Flies like a dream for me!<br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |2015-08-31 |\n",

Little bang for the buck.                 |Keeping everything in perspective, this expansion is average at best.  Do not buy this expansion based on hero and villain bits.  The quality of production is noticeably less than that which came with the original game.  The figures are smaller, and generally cheaper quality.  They don't even look to be on the same scale as those in the base game.  You get very little in regards to extra with this expansion.  What you do get is a continuation of the story, which is superb.  I repeat, do NOT expect nice figures to come with this expansion.  They do not mesh well with the base game in regards to appearance.  Really, they're quite ugly and cheap.  I would rate this expansion with less that 3 stars if based on bang for the buck value.  I give it 3 because of the story and the story alone.  In my opinion, PlaidHat put far more emphasis on the box than anything else.  The box is functionally useless since you'll end up storing all the components with the base game.  However the box is so pretty and sturdy.  You almost want to chuck the garbage figures that came with the expansion and re-purpose the box for something else.  Due to my lack luster impression of quality in this expansion, I will definitely not purchase any more in the series.  You can't sell a product based on a pretty box with inflated reviews....or maybe you can...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |2015-08-31 |\n",

When my son was first introduced to the line it was the Energize series that was sturdy, large, and actually transformed. Like it's recent counterparts, High Tide is a poorly designed and made knock-off of what a great Rescue Bots toy should be.<br />The instructions were confusing in that the pictures did not always match how the toy is actually made. The decals also did not all match the numbering indicated.<br />High Tide himself only folds in half and the cardboard cutouts of Servo and Cody will be lucky to last more than a day. Decals are already peeling, and platforms that are supposed to slide will fall right off.<br />If your kids went crazy over the new recruits like Salvage, Blurr, and High Tide then they will love having this Transformer to add to their collection. Otherwise just pass it up and buy them one of the new Star Wars playsets from the same Playskool Heroes line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |2015-08-31 |\n",

Quality, you get what you pay for--it's a $150 bed. I'm giving it 3 stars due to the painstaking assembly. Some of the pilot holes are completely off, so you'll have to drill on your own. Don't use your power drill for actual drilling though, the faux wood will be eaten alive. Some of my pieces came scratched and dinged. Overall, it probably took me three to four hours to assemble.<br />However, my son completely loves the bed. It fits his old crib mattress perfectly with no gaps. He can get in and out of it easily; the edging at the head ensures he won't roll out. I will be adding hinges to the front storage compartment.<br />I wish there was an option to have it assembled already or much clearer instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |2015-08-30 |\n",
